# Leetcode Solutions Based On Rust
Thanks the great job done by [aylei](https://github.com/aylei/leetcode-rust), here is the version with code refactoring based on `tokio`. Besides, this version removed the feature `all` for which initialize all problems and added solved problems auto-generation in `README.md`.

# Usage
Execute `cargo run`, then you can input one of the below commands:

* `$id`: initialize problem with id in problems/
* `random`: initialize problem with random id in problems/
* `solve $id`: move problem with id from problems/ to solutions/
